## Projects
### Java Jungle
A student project made to fit a client brief. The goal of the project was to create a game based around the theme of "𝗰𝗼𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗲" showcasing the idea of travelling and experiencing life.

The result was 𝗝𝗮𝘃𝗮 𝗝𝘂𝗻𝗴𝗹𝗲, a casual puzzle game where players take the role of an explorer solving box pushing puzzles to collect mystical coffee beans in a tropical locale.

Developed on UE4 for Android and iOS platforms
